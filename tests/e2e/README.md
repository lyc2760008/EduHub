<!-- Notes for fast/local Playwright runs and tag usage. -->
# Playwright E2E

Use the dedicated `e2e-testing` tenant for all E2E runs to keep data isolated.

Admin and portal projects reuse storage state generated by `tests/e2e/setup` to avoid repeated logins.

## Fast runs
- Smoke suite (fastest): `pnpm e2e:smoke`
- Portal suite: `pnpm e2e:portal`
- Admin suite: `pnpm e2e:admin`
- Only changed specs (falls back to smoke): `pnpm e2e:changed`

## Full runs
- All projects: `pnpm e2e:full`

## Tag filters
- `-g "\\[smoke\\]"` for smoke
- `-g "\\[regression\\]"` for regression coverage
- `-g "\\[slow\\]"` for longer workflows
